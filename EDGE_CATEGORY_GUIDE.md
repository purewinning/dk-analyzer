# Edge Category Guide - Updated System

## Overview

The edge categories now properly combine **ownership buckets** with **leverage scores** to show where actual tournament edge exists.

## The Problem with Old System

**Old way:** Only looked at leverage score
- "Elite Leverage" could be a 45% owned player (no real edge!)
- Didn't distinguish between contrarian and chalk plays

**New way:** Combines ownership + leverage + value
- Shows ownership context (Mega Chalk, Chalk, Mid, Contrarian)
- Identifies where true differentiation exists

## Edge Categories by Ownership Tier

### 🔥 MEGA CHALK (40%+ Owned)

These players are in almost half the field. Very hard to gain edge here.

| Category | Criteria | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 🔥 Mega Chalk Edge | Lev > 20, Value > 5.0 | Rare! Chalky but still underowned vs value |
| ⚠️ Mega Chalk (OK) | Lev > 5 | Playable in cash, low GPP edge |
| ❌ Mega Chalk Trap | Lev ≤ 5 | Overowned relative to value - avoid in GPPs |

**Strategy:**
- ❌ **Mega Chalk Trap** = Fade in GPPs completely
- ⚠️ **Mega Chalk (OK)** = Play in cash, 1-2 max in GPPs
- 🔥 **Mega Chalk Edge** = Rare but worth playing if it exists

**Example:**
```
Player: Nikola Jokic
Ownership: 45%
Leverage: 3.2
Category: ❌ Mega Chalk Trap

→ Overowned. If you play him in GPP, you need massive differentiation elsewhere.
```

---

### ⚠️ CHALK (30-40% Owned)

High ownership but not quite mega chalk. Edge exists if value is strong.

| Category | Criteria | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 🔥 Chalk w/ Edge | Lev > 15, Value > 4.8 | High owned but still has leverage |
| ⭐ Chalk (Playable) | Lev > 5 | Solid play, some edge |
| ⚠️ Chalk (Low Edge) | Lev ≤ 5 | Borderline - needs context |

**Strategy:**
- 🔥 **Chalk w/ Edge** = Play confidently, especially in cash
- ⭐ **Chalk (Playable)** = Good for cash, moderate GPP use
- ⚠️ **Chalk (Low Edge)** = Consider fading in GPPs

**Example:**
```
Player: Jayson Tatum
Ownership: 35%
Leverage: 12.4
Value: 5.2
Category: 🔥 Chalk w/ Edge

→ Yes he's chalky, but still underowned vs his value. Good play.
```

---

### ➖✅⭐🔥 MID OWNERSHIP (10-30% Owned)

Sweet spot for GPP builds. Not too high, not too low.

| Category | Criteria | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 🔥 Elite Leverage | Lev > 15, Value > 4.5 | Premium GPP play |
| ⭐ High Leverage | Lev > 10 | Strong GPP option |
| ✅ Good Leverage | Lev > 5 | Solid value play |
| ➖ Mid (Neutral) | Lev 0-5 | Fair ownership, low leverage |
| ➖ Mid (Slight Chalk) | Lev < 0 | Slightly overowned |

**Strategy:**
- 🔥 **Elite Leverage** = Core GPP plays, stack these
- ⭐ **High Leverage** = Very strong GPP exposure
- ✅ **Good Leverage** = Fill spots, good value
- ➖ **Neutral/Slight Chalk** = Situational, needs context

**Example:**
```
Player: Tyrese Maxey
Ownership: 18%
Leverage: 16.8
Value: 4.9
Category: 🔥 Elite Leverage

→ Mid ownership with high value. This is where you build edge.
```

---

### 💎 CONTRARIAN (< 10% Owned)

Low owned = inherent edge. These differentiate your lineups.

| Category | Criteria | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 🔥 Elite Contrarian | Lev > 10, Value > 4.3 | Massive leverage opportunity |
| 💎 Contrarian Edge | Lev > 5 | Strong pivot play |
| 💎 Contrarian Play | Lev > 0 | Decent low-owned option |
| ✅ Contrarian Value | Value > 4.0 | Good value despite low lev |
| ⚠️ Punt Risk | Neither | Low owned for a reason |

**Strategy:**
- 🔥 **Elite Contrarian** = BUILD AROUND THESE in GPPs
- 💎 **Contrarian Edge/Play** = Excellent differentiation
- ✅ **Contrarian Value** = Good value punt
- ⚠️ **Punt Risk** = Cheap filler, understand the risk

**Example:**
```
Player: Derrick White
Ownership: 8%
Leverage: 14.2
Value: 4.7
Category: 🔥 Elite Contrarian

→ Low owned with great value. If he hits, huge leverage vs field.
```

## Summary

**Old system:** Just leverage scores, no ownership context

**New system:** 
- ✅ Shows ownership tier (Mega Chalk, Chalk, Mid, Contrarian)
- ✅ Identifies true leverage opportunities
- ✅ Makes it obvious where edge exists
- ✅ Helps you build differentiated GPP lineups

**Key insight:** A 10% owned player with +10 leverage has MORE edge than a 40% owned player with +15 leverage, even though the leverage score is lower. The new categories reflect this!

Use the edge categories to quickly identify your GPP core plays and avoid the chalk traps. 🎯
