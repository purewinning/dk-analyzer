# Correlation & Stacking Quick Reference

## Core Concepts

### 🎯 Game Stack
**Definition:** Multiple players from the same game

**Why:** If a game goes over the projected total, multiple players benefit

**Example:** Tatum (BOS) + Davis (LAL) from BOS@LAL game

**Sweet Spot:** 3-4 players from one high-scoring game

---

### 🏀 Team Stack  
**Definition:** Multiple players from the same team

**Why:** When a star explodes, teammates get more touches/minutes

**Example:** Giannis + Lillard (both MIL)

**Classic Combo:** High-priced star + mid-priced role player

---

### 🔄 Bring-Back
**Definition:** Opposing player paired with a team stack

**Why:** Hedges your bet while maintaining game correlation

**Example:** 
- Stack: Tatum + Brown (BOS)
- Bring-back: Anthony Davis (LAL)

**Result:** Exposed to both sides of a high-scoring game

---

### 📊 Correlation Score
**Definition:** Measure of how connected your lineup is (0-100)

**Scoring:**
- 0-30: Weak/no correlation
- 30-60: Moderate correlation  
- 60-80: Strong correlation
- 80+: Maximum correlation

**Calculation Factors:**
- Players per game
- Players per team
- Game quality (total proj)
- Number of different games

---

## Contest-Specific Strategies

### 💰 Cash Games (50/50, Double-Up)
```
Correlation: 0.2 (Low)
Strategy: Floor over ceiling
Stacking: Light team stacks only
Ownership: Play the chalk
```

**Why low correlation?**
- Don't need huge ceiling
- Avoid correlated downside
- Want safety and consistency

---

### 🎲 Single Entry GPP
```
Correlation: 0.5 (Moderate)
Strategy: Balance floor and ceiling
Stacking: 1-2 mini stacks
Ownership: Mix chalk and value
```

**Balanced approach:**
- Need some ceiling to win
- Can't be too risky (only 1 lineup)
- Use correlation but don't force it

---

### 🎰 3-Max / 20-Max
```
Correlation: 0.6-0.75 (High)
Strategy: Differentiation via stacking
Stacking: Full game stacks
Ownership: Target low-owned games
```

**Key insight:**
- Multiple lineups = can take more risk
- Want different stack exposures
- Prioritize unique structures

---

### 🏆 150-Max (Milly Maker)
```
Correlation: 0.8-0.9 (Maximum)
Strategy: Ceiling > everything
Stacking: Multi-game stacks + bring-backs
Ownership: Contrarian when possible
```

**Tournament theory:**
- Top 0.1% of field wins big
- Need maximum differentiation
- Correlation amplifies upside
- Accept higher variance

---

## The Stack Spectrum

### No Correlation (0.0-0.2)
```
Lineup: 8 best value plays from 8 different games
Pro: Highest raw projection
Con: No upside leverage
Use: Cash games only
```

### Light Correlation (0.3-0.4)  
```
Lineup: 1 team stack (2 players)
Pro: Some upside, still safe
Con: Limited ceiling
Use: Conservative GPP approach
```

### Moderate Correlation (0.5-0.6)
```
Lineup: 1-2 team stacks, maybe a bring-back
Pro: Balanced risk/reward
Con: May not differentiate enough for large fields
Use: SE, small-field GPPs
```

### High Correlation (0.7-0.8)
```
Lineup: Full game stack (3-4 players from 1-2 games)
Pro: Strong upside potential
Con: Boom or bust
Use: 20-Max, medium GPPs
```

### Maximum Correlation (0.85-1.0)
```
Lineup: Multi-game stacks, bring-backs, everything connected
Pro: Massive ceiling if hits
Con: Very high variance
Use: Milly Maker, contrarian plays
```

## Ownership Matrix

### Stack Ownership Combos

| Primary Own | Secondary Own | Combined | Field % | Edge |
|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|------|
| 40% | 10% | 4% | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 30% | 30% | 9% | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
| 50% | 40% | 20% | High | ⭐ |
| 15% | 8% | 1.2% | Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Key Insight:** Even chalky players can create unique exposures when stacked with low-owned teammates.

---

## Game Selection Guide

### ✅ Target Games
- High projected total (230+)
- Close spread (<7 points)
- Fast pace teams
- Lower game stack ownership
- Star players with value teammates

### ❌ Avoid Games  
- Likely blowouts (spread >12)
- Low totals (<215)
- High game stack ownership (60%+)
- Thin supporting casts
- Injury concerns

---

## Stack Building Priorities

### Priority Order:
1. **Game environment** - Start with a high-upside game
2. **Primary player** - Elite scoring/ceiling player
3. **Secondary player** - Value from same team
4. **Bring-back** - Counter-exposure from opponent  
5. **Fill spots** - Best remaining value

### Anti-Priorities (Don't):
- ❌ Force stacks in low-scoring games
- ❌ Stack teams in blowouts
- ❌ Over-stack (4+ from one team is risky)
- ❌ Ignore salary constraints for correlation

## Common Mistakes

### 🚫 Mistake #1: "All or Nothing"
**Wrong:** Always use maximum correlation
**Right:** Scale to contest type

### 🚫 Mistake #2: "Stack the Chalk"  
**Wrong:** Stack BOS@LAL because it's the highest total
**Right:** Stack BOS@LAL if ownership is reasonable, otherwise pivot

### 🚫 Mistake #3: "Ignore Projections"
**Wrong:** Build pure stacks regardless of projection
**Right:** Balance correlation with raw projection

### 🚫 Mistake #4: "Over-Stack"
**Wrong:** 5+ players from one game
**Right:** 3-4 max, spread across 3-4 games

### 🚫 Mistake #5: "Lock Everything"
**Wrong:** Lock 6 players from 6 different games, then wonder why correlation doesn't work
**Right:** Lock 1-2 key pieces, let builder find the stack

---

## Advanced Tactics

### Contrarian Stacking
```
If BOS@LAL is 60% game stack:
→ Fade it completely
→ Stack DEN@PHX at 20%
→ Same correlation strategy, different game
→ Massive leverage if DEN@PHX hits
```

### Double Game Stack
```
Game 1: BOS@LAL (2 from BOS, 1 from LAL)
Game 2: DEN@PHX (2 from DEN)
Fills: 3 players from 3 different games
→ Exposed to 2 high-upside games
→ Unique structure
```

### Leverage Stack
```
Start with high-leverage player (elite ceiling, low own)
→ Stack their teammates
→ Add bring-back
→ Entire stack is leverage play
```

## Cheat Sheet

### Contest → Correlation
- Cash → 0.2
- SE → 0.5  
- 3-Max → 0.6
- 20-Max → 0.75
- Milly → 0.85

### Score Interpretation
- Corr < 40 → Weak/Traditional

## Quick Decision Tree

```
1. What contest?
   └─ Cash → Low correlation (0.2)
   └─ GPP → High correlation (0.7+)

2. Field size?
   └─ Small (<1000) → Moderate (0.5)
   └─ Large (5000+) → High (0.8)

3. Any strong preferences?
   └─ Yes → Lock them, set correlation to 0.6+
   └─ No → Let builder decide, set correlation to contest default

4. Risk tolerance?
   └─ Conservative → Dial down 0.1-0.2
   └─ Aggressive → Dial up 0.1-0.2
```

## Remember

> "In GPPs, you don't win by having the highest projection.  
> You win by having a unique structure that hits."

**Correlation creates the structure. Projection still matters. Balance both.**

---

## Builder Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Start with contest defaults
- Let builder find natural stacks
- Review correlation scores
- Mix correlation levels across lineups

❌ **DON'T:**
- Max out correlation for all contests
- Force stacks in bad games
- Lock too many players
- Ignore projection completely

---

## Success Metrics

After your contests run, compare:

1. **Correlated lineups vs Non-correlated**
   - Top score
   - Average score
   - Min cash rate

2. **Optimal correlation level**
   - What worked for your contest type?
   - Adjust defaults accordingly

3. **Stack success rate**
   - Which game stacks hit?
   - Were they owned or contrarian?

**Iterate and improve!** 📈
